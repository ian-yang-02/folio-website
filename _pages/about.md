Hello! I'm a 4th-year undergrad studying computer science at Georgia Tech. I also dabble in mathematics, philosophy, and linguistics.

Broadly, I'm interested in understanding the sociocultural implications of language technologies and how to minimize non-normative behaviors in intelligent agents.

My current research at Georgia Tech is in NLP techniques applied to the [value alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) problem, advised by [Mark Riedl](http://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl.html).

I'm also a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/). At CMU I'm interested in NLP applied to data security and [privacy](https://usableprivacy.org/).

Previously, I was a research assistant at The Ohio State University (advised by [Dong Xuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=11NcM2EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)), and a Full-Stack Software Engineering Intern at [FlightBridge](https://flightbridge.com/).
