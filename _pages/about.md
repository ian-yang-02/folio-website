Hello! I'm a senior studying computer science at Georgia Tech. I'm investigating NLP techniques applied to the [value alignment](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/ethics/value-alignment/) problem, advised by [Mark Riedl](http://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl.html).

I'm in the process of writing my undergraduate thesis, tentatively titled <i>Relationship Extraction via Language Models for Normativity Analysis</i>.

I'm also a visiting research intern at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/). At CMU I'm interested in NLP applied to data security and [privacy](https://usableprivacy.org/).

Previously I was a Research Intern at The Ohio State University, advised by [Dong Xuan](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~xuan.3/). At OSU I worked primarily on ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition).

I also was previously at [FlightBridge](https://flightbridge.com/), where I was a Full-Stack Software Engineering Intern.
